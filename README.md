# Libbitcoin Protocol

*Bitcoin Blockchain Query Protocol Library*

Note that you need g++ 4.8 or higher. For this reason Ubuntu 12.04 and older are not supported. Make sure you have installed [libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin) beforehand according to its build instructions, as well as libzmq.

```sh
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```

libbitcoin-protocol is now installed in `/usr/local/`.
